## The ðŸ”­StorySeeker Dataset and Codebook

This dataset includes 502 texts annotated with story- and event-spans.

Our full codebook can be found [here](https://github.com/maria-antoniak/stories-online-communities/blob/main/codebook.md).

This dataset annotates Reddit posts and comments from the [Webis-TLDR-17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/webis/tldr-17) dataset.

We assign each of the top 500 subreddits in the dataset to a thematic category. These 33 categories can be found [here](https://github.com/maria-antoniak/stories-online-communities/blob/main/subreddit_categories.csv).
